# Decision-modelling-for-investment

## Project Overview
This repository contains two decision modelling projects completed for MIS775 – Decision Modelling for Business Analytics at Deakin University. Both assignments focus on building and applying mathematical optimisation models to solve real-world investment problems using Microsoft Excel Solver.

### Assignment 1 – Investment Portfolio Optimisation (Linear and Integer Programming)
Objective:
To construct optimal investment portfolios by analysing real stock market data and applying advanced optimisation techniques.

Key Tasks:
Selected 8 ASX-listed stocks from 4 different sectors
Calculated monthly returns and risk levels
Classified investments into three risk categories (R1, R2, R3)

Developed:
Linear Programming (LP) model with constraints on sector mix and risk appetite
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model with constraints on portfolio size and investment diversity
Performed Sensitivity Analysis to assess the impact of constraint changes
Presented findings in a PowerPoint report with algebraic models, solver outputs, and strategic recommendations

### Assignment 2 – Business Decision Modelling with Real Data
Objective:
To further explore decision modelling for business scenarios using real or simulated datasets (details can vary depending on the task description, e.g., transportation, scheduling, or financial planning).

Key Tasks:
Modelled a complex business scenario using Excel
Developed and tested LP or ILP solutions
Applied scenario analysis and solver tools to find optimal outcomes
Interpreted results in terms of business insights and trade-offs
